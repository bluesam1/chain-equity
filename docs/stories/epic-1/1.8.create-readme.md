## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- README location: `chain-equity/README.md`
- Project structure: Monorepo with npm workspaces
- Workspaces: `contracts/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`

### Architecture Decisions
- Monorepo structure for simplified development
- npm workspaces for dependency management
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Clear separation between contracts, backend, and frontend

### Key Constraints
- README must enable one-command setup
- Must include all necessary setup steps
- Must be clear and easy to follow
- Must include troubleshooting tips if needed

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: N/A (documentation story)
- **Test Standards**: Manual verification of README instructions
- **Testing Frameworks**: N/A
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Verify all setup steps work as documented
  - Verify one-command setup works
  - Verify environment variable setup works
  - Test with fresh clone of repository

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor)

### Debug Log References
N/A - No debug issues encountered

### Completion Notes List
1. Enhanced existing README.md with comprehensive project overview section including:
   - Detailed description of ChainEquity as a tokenized security prototype
   - Key features list (gated transfers, corporate actions, cap-table management, RBAC, Web3 auth, production-ready UI)
   - Project goals (on-chain compliance, production-quality prototype, real-time tracking, corporate actions, end-to-end solution)
2. Added dedicated Tech Stack section organized by category:
   - Blockchain & Smart Contracts (Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, ethers.js)
   - Frontend (Vite.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, wagmi)
   - Backend & Authentication (Supabase Web3 Auth, Node.js, TypeScript)
   - Development Tools (npm workspaces, Hardhat Test)
3. Enhanced setup instructions with one-command setup:
   - Highlighted `npm install` as the recommended one-command setup
   - Explained that npm workspaces automatically installs all workspace dependencies
   - Kept manual installation steps as fallback option
4. Verified all existing sections meet requirements:
   - Environment variable setup instructions (already comprehensive)
   - Development workflow instructions (already comprehensive)
   - Project structure section (enhanced with detailed directory tree and workspace explanations)
   - Documentation links (already present)
5. Enhanced project structure section with:
   - Detailed directory tree showing all workspaces and key directories
   - Workspace structure explanations for contracts, frontend, backend, and docs
   - Key directories descriptions for easy navigation
6. All acceptance criteria met - README is comprehensive and enables quick project understanding and setup

### File List
- `README.md` (modified - enhanced with overview, tech stack, improved setup instructions, and detailed project structure)
