2. Firebase project initialized
3. Firebase Hosting configuration file (`firebase.json`) created
4. Build output configured to `dist/` directory
5. Environment variables configured for production
6. Deployment scripts added to `package.json`
7. Firebase deployment works successfully
8. Application accessible via Firebase Hosting URL
9. Environment variables properly configured for production

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Frontend workspace: `frontend/`
- Firebase config: `frontend/firebase.json`
- Build output: `frontend/dist/`
- Environment variables: `frontend/.env.production`
- Package.json: `frontend/package.json`

### Front-End Specification References
- **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting required per Epic 5 PRD
- **Build Output:** Must output to `dist/` directory for Firebase

### Architecture Decisions
- Firebase Hosting for deployment
- Build output to `dist/` directory
- Environment variables for production configuration
- Deployment scripts for easy deployment

### Key Constraints
- Must use Firebase Hosting
- Build output must be `dist/` directory
- Environment variables must be configured for production
- Deployment must work successfully

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: Manual verification
- **Test Standards**: Manual deployment testing
- **Testing Frameworks**: N/A (deployment story)
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Verify Firebase Hosting configuration
  - Verify build output
  - Verify environment variables
  - Verify deployment works
  - Verify application accessible
  - Test all functionality in deployed environment
